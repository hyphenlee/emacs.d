Frequently Asked Questions about GLOBAL.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Q0. Please explain about BOKINware.

A0. GNU GLOBAL is BOKINware. It means that it is free software
    based on GNU GPL, and is commercial (for-profit) software
    based on BOKIN model.

    BOKIN Model is a business model to obtain proceeds by widely
    collecting donations while developing and distributing
    free software. This model is constructed not to take away
    consumer's freedom of software, and is similar to the model
    of FSF except that FSF is not commercial organization.
    Your contribution is put on donors list in DONORS file, and
    distributed all over the world with GNU GLOBAL itself.

    Please see the files: DONORS, BOKIN_MODEL and BOKIN_MODEL_FAQ
    for more details.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Q1. Does GLOBAL support DOS and Windows 32 environment?

A1. No, it doesn't. GNU GLOBAL supports only UNIX(POSIX) environment.
    But some outside projects develop DOS and Windows 32 version of it.
    Please see:
           http://www.gnu.org/software/global/download.html

    Though GLOBAL doesn't supports DOS and Windows 32 environment,
    we accept the code for them if the following requirements are met:
    o It works in DOS and(or) Windows 32 environment.
    o It doesn't influence UNIX environment.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Q2. GLOBAL skips some functions.
    For example, GLOBAL skips the function 'func()' in this example.

	#define M(a)	static char *string = a;

	M(a)

	func() {		<= GLOBAL skip func().
		...
	}

A2. GLOBAL cannot recognize 'func()', because M(a) seems to be a function
    definition.

    It should be follows:

	#define M(a)	static char *string = a

	M(a);			<= end with ';'

	func() {
		...
	}

    Otherwise, you can tell gtags(1) that 'M' is not a function by listing
    the macros in '.notfunction' file in the current directory.

	[.notfunction]
	+---------------
	|M
	|...

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Q3. I'm a C++ programmer. Why does not gtags pick up the class names in *.h?

A3. GLOBAL treats *.h files as a C source file. If you want to treat them
    as a C++ source file, please set environment variable GTAGSFORCECPP.

	% setenv GTAGSFORCECPP

        or

	$ export GTAGSFORCECPP=

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Q4. I'm using GNU system. In a large project, gtags fails in making tags
    like follows:

	$ gtags
	gtags: cannot write to database.
	$ _

    File system is not full. It seems that gtags cannot make a file over 2GB.
    Any solution?

A4. If your GNU system supports 64-bit file offset then please try the
    following configuration.

	$ ./configure CFLAGS='-D_LARGEFILE64_SOURCE -D_FILE_OFFSET_BITS=64'

Q7. Gtags(1) and htags(1) work only for one directory tree. So, we cannot
    refer library functions like strlen() from my project. Any solutions?

A7. For global(1), you can use GTAGSLIBPATH environment variable.

	[library]	/usr/src/lib
	[your project]	/usr/home/project

	$ (cd /usr/src/lib; gtags)
	$ export GTAGSLIBPATH=/usr/src/lib
	$ global strlen
	../../../usr/src/lib/libc/string/strlen.c

    Or, you can take a more straightforward way to do the same thing.
    In the following example, you treat as if the system library is
    part of your project. This way is effective also to htags(1).

	$ cd /usr/home/project
	$ ln -s /usr/src/lib .
	$ gtags
	$ htags

Q10. Does GLOBAL support multi-byte code set?
     Which character code set is supported?

A10. GLOBAL doesn't support multi-byte character code set yet.
     GLOBAL supports only ASCII and ASCII supersets.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Q11. Can GLOBAL running on a UNIX machine treat source files
     which include DOS/Windows style new-line code? And vice versa? 

A11. GLOBAL supports only native text format of POSIX.
     Besides, please go by the own responsibility.
