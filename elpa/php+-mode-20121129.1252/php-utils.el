;; php-utils.el was created as part of the php+-mode suite and contains
;; miscellaneous utility functions that do not have a home elsewhere,
;; but that are useful nonetheless and should not be cluttering up
;; users' .emacs.  We willprobably add defcustoms later so that people
;; may turn off these functionalities.
