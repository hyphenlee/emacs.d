Compose and reuse Emacs regular expressions with ease.

If you ever tried to write more than a few of related regexps and it felt
that there should be a way to pick out their common parts and just plug them
in without worrying about grouping and precedence, this package is for you.

It is implemented over the great Emacs package called `rx' that enables
structural regexp editing while avoiding the colorful jungles of backslashes
and spices it up with the ability to define your own subforms and use them
to construct readable and maintainable regexps.
