This package provides functions to display system notifications for
any org-mode deadlines that are due in your agenda. To perform a
one-shot check call (org-alert-deadlines). To enable repeated
checking call (org-alert-enable) and to disable call
(org-alert-disable). You can set the checking interval by changing
the org-alert-interval variable to the number of seconds you'd
like.
