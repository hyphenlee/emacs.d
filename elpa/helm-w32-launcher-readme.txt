Launch Start Menu entries using Emacs and Helm.
Why?
 * Why not?
 * Because Helm is superior to the Start Menu (or Start Screen) search
   feature.

To use, see the following commands:
 * `helm-w32-launcher'
 * `helm-w32-launcher-elevated'
 * `helm-w32-launcher-open-shortcut-directory'
 * `helm-w32-launcher-open-shortcut-properties'
