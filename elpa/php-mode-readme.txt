PHP mode is a major mode for editing PHP source code.  It's an
extension of C mode; thus it inherits all C mode's navigation
functionality.  But it colors according to the PHP grammar and
indents according to the PEAR coding guidelines.  It also includes
a couple handy IDE-type features such as documentation search and a
source and class browser.
