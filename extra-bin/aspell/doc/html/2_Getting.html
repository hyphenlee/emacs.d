2.1 Requirements
</H1>

<P>
Aspell requires gcc 2.95 (or better) as the C++ compiler. Other C++
compilers should work with some effort. Other C++ compilers for mostly
POSIX compliant (Unix, Linux, BeOS, CygWin) systems should work with
out any major problems provided that the compile can handle all of
the advanced C++ features Aspell uses. C++ compilers for non-Unix
systems might work but it will take some work. Aspell at very least
requires a Unix-like environment (sh, grep, sed, tr, etc...) in order
to build. Aspell also uses a few POSIX functions when necessary.

<P>

<H1><A NAME="SECTION00320000000000000000">
2.2 Obtaining</A>

2.4 Helping Out</A>
</H1>

<P>
I have very little time to work on Aspell so I desperately need other
people to help with the development of Aspell. There are a lot of
things that need to be done before I consider Aspell complete. See
section <A HREF="B_Do.html#todo">B.1</A> for a list of them. I would really appreciate
some help with doing them. If you are interested in helping with one
of them please let me know.

<P>
I am also looking for someone to eventually take over the maintenance
and development of Aspell. If you are interested please contact me
directly.

<BLOCKQUOTE>
./configure &amp;&amp; make

</BLOCKQUOTE>
For additional configure options type ./configure &#45;&#45;help. You can
control what C++ compiler is used by setting the environmental variable
CXX before running configure and you can control what flags are passed
to the C++ compile via the environmental variable CXXFLAGS. Static
libraries are disabled by default since static libraries will not
work right due to the mixing of C and C++. When a C program links
with the static libraries in Aspell it is likely to crash because
Aspell's C++ objects are not getting initialized correctly. However,
if for some reason you want them, you can enable them via &#45;&#45;enable-static.

<P>
Aspell should then compile with out any additional user intervention.
If you run into problems please first check the sections below as
that might solve your problem.

<P>
To install the program simply type

<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
make install

</BLOCKQUOTE>
After Aspell is installed at least one dictionary needs to be installed.
You can find them at <TT><A NAME="tex2html4"
  HREF="http://aspell.net/">http://aspell.net/</A></TT>. The &#34;aspell&#34;
program must be in your path in order for the dictionaries to install
correctly.

<P>
If you do not have Ispell or the traditional Unix ``spell'' utility
installed on your system than you should also copy the compatibly
scripts ``ispell'' and ``spell'' located in the scripts/ directory
into your binary directory which is usually /usr/local/bin so that
programs that expect ispell or spell command will work correctly.

<P>

<H2><A NAME="SECTION00352000000000000000">
2.5.2 General Problems</A>

<P>
Aspell does not use a released version of GNU Libtool. If you have
a need to modify configure.ac or any of the Makefile.am's you should
install the CVS version of libtool.

2.5.3 Curses Notes</A>
</H2>

<P>
If you are having problems compiling termios.cc than the most likely
reason is due to incompatibilities with the curses implementation
on your system. If this is the case than you can explicitly disable
the curses library with &#45;&#45;disable-curses. By doing this you will lose
the nice full screen interface but hopefully you will be able to at
least get Aspell to compile correctly.

<P>
If the curses library is installed in a non-standard location than
you can specify the library and include directory with &#45;&#45;enable-curses=«lib»
and &#45;&#45;enable-curses-include=«dir».
<B>Lib</B> can either be the complete path of the library (for example
``/usr/local/curses/libcurses.a''), the name of the library (for
example ``ncurses'') or a combined location and library in the
form ``-L«lib dir» -l«lib»''
(for example ``-L/usr/local/ncurses/lib -lncurses''). <B>Dir</B>
is the location of the curses header files (for example ``/usr/local/ncurses/include'').

2.5.4 Upgrading from Aspell .33/Pspell .12</A>
</H2>

<P>
Aspell has undergone an extremely large number of changes since the
previous Aspell/Pspell release. For one thing Pspell has been merged
with Aspell so there in no longer two separate libraries you have
to worry about.

<P>
Because of the massive changes between Aspell/Pspell and Aspell 0.50
you may want to clean out the old files before installing the the
new Aspell. To do so do a ``make uninstall'' in the original Aspell
and Pspell source directories.

<P>
The way dictionaries are handled has also changed. This includes a
change in the naming conventions of both language names and dictionaries.
Due to the language name change, your old personal dictionaries will
not be recognized. However, you can import the old dictionaries by
running the ``aspell-import'' script. This also means that dictionaries
designed to work with older versions of Aspell are not likely to function
correctly. Fortunately new dictionary packages are available for most
languages. You can find them off of the Aspell home page at <TT><A NAME="tex2html5"
  HREF="http://aspell.net">http://aspell.net</A></TT>.

<P>
The Pspell ABI is now part of Aspell except that the name of everything
has changed due to the renaming of Pspell to Aspell. In particular
please note the following name changes:

<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
pspell -&gt; aspell
<BR>
manager -&gt; speller
<BR>
emulation -&gt; enumeration
<BR>
master_word_list -&gt; main_word_list

</BLOCKQUOTE>
Please also note that the name of the <B>language-tag</B> option
has changed to <B>lang</B>. However, for backward compatible the
language-tag option will still work.

<P>
However, you should also be able to build applications that require
Pspell with the new Aspell as a backward compatibility header file
is provided.

<P>
Due to a change in the way dictionaries are handled, scanning for
.pwli files in order to get find out which dictionaries are available
will no longer work. This means that programs that relied on this
technique may have problems finding dictionaries. Fortunately, GNU
Aspell now provided a uniform way to list all installed dictionaries
via the C API. See the file ``list-dicts.c'' in the examples/
directory for an example of how to due this. Unfortunately there is
isn't any simply way to find out which dictionaries are installed
which will work with both the old Aspell/Pspell and the new GNU Aspell.

2.5.5 Upgrading from a pre-release snapshot</A>
</H2>

<P>
At the last minute I decided to merge the ``speller-util'' program
into the main ``aspell'' program. You may right to remove that
speller-util program to avoid confusion. This also means that dictionaries
designed to work with the snapshot will no longer work with the official
release.

2.5.6.2 Building</A>
</H3>

<P>
There are two basically different ways of building ASpell using GCC
for Win32: You can either use the Cygwin compiler, which will produce
binaries that depend on the posix layer in cygwin1.dll. The other
way is using MinGW GCC, those binaries use the native C runtime from
Microsoft (MSVCRT.DLL). If you intend to use or link against the Aspell
libraries using a native Win32 compiler (e.g. MS Visual C++), you
will need the MinGW built ones to avoid problems caused by the different
runtime libraries.

<P>
Building Aspell using Cygwin: This works exactly like on other posix
compatible systems using the &#34;configure &amp;&amp; make &amp;&amp; make
install&#34; cycle. Some versions of Cygwin GCC will fail to
link, this is caused by an incorrect libstdc++.la in the /lib directory.
After removing or renaming this file, the build progress should work
(GCC-2.95 and GCC-3.x should work).

<P>
Building Aspell using MinGW: To compile Aspell with the MinGW compiler,
you will need at least GCC-3.2 (as shipped with MinGW-2.0.3) and some
GNU tools like rm and cp. The origin of those tools doesn't matter,
it has shown to work with any tools from MinGW/MSys, Cygwin or Linux.
To build Aspell, move into the win32 subdirectory and type &#34;make&#34;.
You can enable some additional build options by either commenting
out the definitions at the head of the Makefile or passing those values
as environment variables or at the make command line. Following options
are supported: 

<P>
<DL>
<DT><STRONG>DEBUGVERSION</STRONG></DT>
<DD>If set to &#34;1&#34;, the binaries will
include debugging information (resulting in a much bigger size).
</DD>
<DT><STRONG>CURSESDIR</STRONG></DT>
<DD>Enter the path to the pdcurses library here, in order
to get a nicer console interface (see below). 
</DD>
<DT><STRONG>MSVCLIB</STRONG></DT>
<DD>Enter the filename of MS lib.exe here, if you want to build
libraries that can be imported from MS Visual C++. 
</DD>
<DT><STRONG>WIN32_RELOCATABLE</STRONG></DT>
<DD>If set to &#34;1&#34;, Aspell will
detect the prefix from the path where the DLL resides (see below for
further datails). 
</DD>
<DT><STRONG>TARGET</STRONG></DT>
<DD>Sets a prefix to be used for cross compilation (e.g. &#34;/usr/local/bin/i586-mingw32msvc-&#34;
to cross compile from linux). 
</DD>
</DL>
There are also a MinGW compilers available for Cygwin and Linux, both
versions are able to compile Aspell using the prebuilt Makefile. While
the Cygwin port automatically detects the correct compiler, the Linux
version depends on setting the &#34;TARGET&#34; variable
in the Makefile (or environment) to the correct compiler prefix.

<P>
Other compilers may work. There is a patch for MS Visual C++ 6.0 available
at <TT><A NAME="tex2html7"
  HREF="ftp://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/aspell">ftp://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/aspell</A></TT>, but it needs a lot of changes
to the Aspell sources. It has also been reported that the Intel C++
compiler can be used for compilation.

<P>

<H3><A NAME="SECTION00356300000000000000">
2.5.6.3 (PD)Curses</A>
</H3>

<P>
In order to get the nice full screen interface when spell checking
files a curses implementation that does not require Cygwin is required.
The PDCurses (<TT><A NAME="tex2html8"
  HREF="http://pdcurses.sourceforge.net">http://pdcurses.sourceforge.net</A></TT>) implementation
is known to work, other implementations may work however they have
not been tested. See the previous section for information on specifying
the location of the curses library and include file.

<P>
Curses notes:

<P>

<UL>
<LI>PDcurses built with MinGW needs to be compiled with <TT>-DPDC_STATIC_BUILD</TT>
to avoid duplicate declaration of DllMain when compiling aspell.exe.
</LI>
<LI>The curses enabled version can cause trouble in some shells (MSys
rxvt, emacs) and will produce errors like ``<TT>initscr() LINES=1
COLS=1: too small</TT>''. Use a non-curses version for those purposes.

2.5.6.4 Directories</A>

<P>
If Aspell is compiled with WIN32_RELOCATABLE=1, it can be run from
any directory: It will set «prefix» according to its install location
(assuming it resides in «prefix»&#92;bin). Your personal
wordlists will be saved in the «prefix» directory with their names
changed from ``<TT>.aspell.&lt;lang&gt;.*</TT>'' to ``<TT>&lt;lang&gt;.*</TT>''
(you can override the path by setting the HOME environment variable).

2.5.6.5 Installer</A>
</H3>

<P>
The installer registers the DLLs as shared libraries, you should increase
the reference counter to avoid the libraries being uninstalled if
your application still depends on them (and decrease it again when
uninstalling your program). The reference counters are located under:

<P>
<TT>HKLM&#92;SOFTWARE&#92;Microsoft&#92;Windows&#92;CurrentVersion&#92;SharedDLLs</TT>

<H3><A NAME="SECTION00356600000000000000">
2.5.6.6 Win32 consoles</A>
</H3>

<P>
The console uses a different encoding than GUI applications, changing
this to to a Windows encoding (e.g. 1252) is not supported on Win9x/Me.
On WinNT (and later) those codepages can be set by first changing
the console font to ``<TT>lucida console</TT>'', then changing
the codepage using ``<TT>chcp 1252</TT>''.

<P>
Some alternative shells (e.g. MSys' rxvt or Cygwin's bash) do a codepage
conversion (if correctly set up), so running Aspell inside those shells
might be a workaround for Win9x.

2.6 Using aspell-import</A>

<P>
The aspell-import Perl script will look for old personal dictionaries
and will import them into GNU Aspell. It will look for both Ispell

you get an error about /usr/bin/perl not being found than instead
try ``perl «bindir»/aspell-import''.
When running the script if you get a message like:
