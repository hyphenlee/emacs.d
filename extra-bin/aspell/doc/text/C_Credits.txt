C. Credits

  * To the FSF for adopting the project.
  * To the many authors of Ispell (including R. E. Gorin, Pace Willisson,
    and Geoff Kuenning) for providing me with a good word list as well as
    giving me a few good ideas.
  * Alan Beale for going well beyond the call of duty with helping me
    create a better word list.
  * Lawrence Philips for coming up with the original metaphone algorithm
    and Michael Kuhn for writing C code for the algorithm.
  * Björn Jacke for coming up with a generic soundslike algorithm which
    gets all of its data from a file, thus eliminating almost all need for
    language specific code from aspell.
  * To the authors of SGI STL version 3.0 and up for proving a great set
    of generic container classes with cut the development time of this
    program in half at least.
  * To the LyX development team for giving me a great tool for the
    development of this manual.
